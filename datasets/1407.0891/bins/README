Data is taken from tables 5-13 of the paper, representing the average
of the e and mu channels. Datafiles are as follows:

jet25.dat: jet multiplicity distribution with pT(jet)>25 GeV.
jet40.dat: jet multiplicity distribution with pT(jet)>40 GeV.
jet60.dat: jet multiplicity distribution with pT(jet)>60 GeV.
jet80.dat: jet multiplicity distribution with pT(jet)>80 GeV.

ptjet1.dat: pt distribution of the leading jet.
ptjet2.dat: pt distribution of the second jet.
ptjet3.dat: pt distribution of the third jet.
ptjet4.dat: pt distribution of the fourth jet.
ptjet5.dat: pt distribution of the fifth jet.

All cross-sections are in pb. Total relative uncertainties have been
converted to absolute errors.
