Cross-sections correspond to the figures in table 15 of the paper, and
the datafiles are labelled as follows:

lepjets.dat: sigma_{ttb lepton-plus-jets}
bmu.dat: sigma_{ttb e mu}
ttbb.dat: sigma_{ttbb cut-based}

The first two results have asymmetric systematic errors. I have added
the upper and lower errors in quadrature, then shifted the central
value to give a symmetric error band.
