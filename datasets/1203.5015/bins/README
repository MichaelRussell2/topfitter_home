This directory contains data from tables 2 and 3 of
arXiv:1203.5015. The data is presented with asymmetric error bars, and
so I have added upper and lower errors in quadrature before shifting
the central values to make a symmetric error band.

Labelling of data files is as follows:

fQ0_0.8.dat: Gap fraction f(Q_0) with |y|<0.8
fQ0_0.8_1.5.dat: Gap fraction f(Q_0) with 0.8<=|y|<1.5
fQ0_1.5_2.1.dat: Gap fraction f(Q_0) with 1.5<=|y|<2.1
fQ0_2.1.dat: Gap fraction f(Q_0) with |y|<2.1

The files fQsum_*.dat are as above, but for f(Q_{sum}).

The format of each data file is

Q    f    Err,

where Q=Q_0 or Q_{sum}, f is the gap fraction, and Err the
uncertainty.
