This directory contains the data from tables 1-6 of arXiv:1404.3171,
labelled as follows:

jet_pt30.dat: Jet multiplicity distribution with p_{T,jet} > 30GeV,
dilepton channel.

jet_pt60.dat: Jet multiplicity distribution with p_{T,jet} > 60GeV,
dilepton channel.

jet_pt35.dat: Jet multiplicity distribution with p_{T,jet} > 35 GeV,
lepton + jets channel.

gap_pt.dat: Gap fraction f(p_t).

gap_ht.dat: Gap fraction f(H_t).

The jet multiplicity files have format

binmin    binmax    result    error

where the bins correspond to the number of jets. The gap fraction
files have format

Q    result    error

where Q is the p_t or H_t threshold.
